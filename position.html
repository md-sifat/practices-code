	The national flag of Bangladesh (Bengali: 
	বাংলাদেশের জাতীয় পতাকা, romanized: Bānlādēśēra jātīẏa patākā, 
	pronounced [baŋlad̪eʃer dʒat̪io̪ pɔt̪aka]) was adopted officially
	on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red disc on top (similar
	to that on Japan's flag) of a green field. The red disc is
	offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centred 
	when the flag is flying. The disc represents the sun rising 
	over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the
	independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the
	lushness of the land of Bangladesh and the eternal youth of
	Bangladeshis.

The flag is based on a similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, 
which had a yellow map of the country inside the red disc. In 1972 this map was removed
 from the flag. One reason given was the difficulty for rendering the map correctly on
 both sides of the flag.[1] The civil ensign and naval ensign place it in the canton 
 of a red or white field, respectively. 
 
	
	
	The first version of the flag was designed and made by a section of student leaders and activists of Swadheen Bangla Nucleus on 6 June 1970, at room 108 of Iqbal Hall (now Sergeant Zahurul Haq hall), Dhaka University; students involved with the design were namely Kazi Aref Ahmed, ASM Abdur Rab, Shahjahan Siraj, Manirul Islam (Marshal Moni), Swapan Kumar Choudhury, Quamrul Alam Khan Khasru, Hasanul Haq Inu, and Yousuf Salahuddin Ahmed.[citation needed] The flag was made from clothes donated by Bazlur Rahman Lasker, the owner of Apollo Tailors, Dhaka New Market.[2]

A map of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was first traced on a tracing paper from an atlas by Hasanul Haq Inu, Yousuf Salahuddin Ahmed and Enamul Haq, at Enamul's room (312) in Quaid-I Azam Hall (now Sher-E-Bangla Hall), EPUET (now BUET).[3][4] Later the map was painted in the red circle by Shib Narayan Das.[5] On 2 March 1971, this initial version of the flag was hoisted in Bangladesh for the first time at Dhaka University, by student leader A. S. M. Abdur Rab, the then Vice President of Dhaka University Students' Union (DUCSU)[6] The flag was conceived so as to exclude the star and crescent considered as symbols of West Pakistan (now Pakistan).

According to CIA World Fact Book,[1][7] the green used in the flag represents the lushness of the green landscape of the country.[8][9] On 13 January 1972 the flag was modified. The map from the center was removed, and the red disk moved towards the hoist. The red in the center is a symbolic representation of the blood Bengalis shed in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[9]
